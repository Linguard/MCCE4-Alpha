## Welcome to __MCCE4-Alpha__!  

#### See our CHANGELOG at the bottom for the latest updates!

# If you have sudo access or would like a system-wide installation of the needed softwares:
The file `MCCE_bin/sudo_install.txt` has the necessary information for you or your sys admin to install the packages. To display the file, run this command:
```
 cat ./MCCE_bin/sudo_install.txt
```

# "Quick Install" script `MCCE_bin/quick_install.sh`:
__Note: The quick install script will not modify an existing conda environment named 'mc4'.__ 
If you want to re-create it, run this command before running the script:
```
 conda env remove -n mc4
```

### What this script does:
  - Checks for required `conda`; Stops if not found so you can install it (commands provided).
  - Create a conda environment for MCCE4 named 'mc4' (using 'mc4.yml').
  - Checks for required `apptainer`; If a system Apptainer installation is not found & an 'unprivilege' version cannot be installed, Apptainer is conda-installed in 'mc4'.
  - Downloads the generic image for NGPB in MCCE4/bin.
  - Adds export commands to the PATH variable in ~/.bashrc for:
    * 'MCCE4/bin' and 'MCCE4/MCCE4_bin'
    * the unprivilege version of Apptainer if installed by the script
 - Script code: [quick_install.sh](./MCCE_bin/quick_install.sh)

#### Quick Installation:
  1. Clone this repo, then cd into it with this command:
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/GunnerLab/MCCE4-Alpha.git; cd MCCE4-Alpha;
  ```
  
  2. Run the `quick_install.sh` script to download MCCE PBE solver (NGPB) image file and create a conda environment for MCCE4 (this may need several passes if you need to install dependencies such as miniconda and apptainer):
  ```
   bash ./MCCE_bin/quick_install.sh
  ```

## __Quick Introduction__

Given the structure of a macromolucule (in a PDB file), __MCCE4__ can predict the following:

- __pKₐ values__
- __Protonation states__
- __Electrostatic properties__ of biomolecules

In this program, protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.

## __Documentation Overview__
Comprehensive documentation covering:
- Installation
- Guide: Detailed explanations of all settings
- Example Projects

# CHANGELOG:
_This section will reflect important changes and will provide you with information on how to apply them; For example, if new python packages are added to the environment file (mc4.yml), then the entry pertaining to that change will list the command(s) to update your environment._ 

* 2025-10-30:
  - Updated README: Added CHANGELOG, link to sudo_install.txt
  - Added topologies for SO4 and PO4 in param/.
  - Updated bin/step3.py with longer timeout value
  - Updated MCCE_bin/quick_install.sh
  - __Apply changes with `git pull`__
